# 🚀 Getting Started

Follow the instructions below to set up the project locally.

## 🔧 Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/disease-prediction-app.git
cd disease-prediction-app

   ```
2. **Set Up a Virtual Environment (Optional but recommended):**


```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`

```
3. **Install dependencies:**


```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

```

## 🛠️ Running the Project
4. **Start the backend server:**

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```
The application will open in your default web browser.


## How It Works
- **Model Training**:Models are trained using datasets relevant to diabetes, Parkinson's, and heart disease. The algorithms used include Support Vector Machines (SVM) and logistic regression.
- **Data Input**:Users can provide input data through a camera interface integrated into the application.
- **Prediction**: The Streamlit framework processes the input data and displays the prediction results in real time.
